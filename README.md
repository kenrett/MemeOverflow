## Contributing

1. Fork the repo

2. Build a feature on your own branch. i.e git branch <branchname>

3. Write some tests, ideally between 1-10 per feature. You decide how many before you ask us to pull, we decide if your feature is dangerous or not.

4. Have a sense of humor and realize that you just contributed to an open source project. High five!
